Install instructions. 

- Copy the folders "bin" and "XV2PATCHER" to the main root of DB Xenoverse 2 installation.
On a default Steam installation, that would be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DB Xenoverse 2"

Your loose files go in the main install directory, following the same path that in the cpk.
For example, the file data/sound/CAR_BGM.acb would go in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DB Xenoverse 2\data\sound\CAR_BGM.acb" on default install.

- Rename the file "EasyAntiCheat/EasyAntiCheat_x64.dll" to anything else to avoid easy anti cheat module from being loaded.
- Run the game from the bin folder (bin/DBXV2.exe) to avoid "untrusted system file error".
  If you still get error problems caused by the Easy Anti Cheat rootkit, run DBXV2.exe as administrator.
